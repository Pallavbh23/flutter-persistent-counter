# Persistent Counter App

My first Flutter application. It modifies the Flutter counter app so that the counter value remains persistent even after closing the app. It also has a down counter. I have modified it to be a fun slap counter app in which the name of the victim can be changed by entering it in the text bar provided. Since it was my first time using Flutter, I have tried experimenting various things so my app might have residual code in the form of comments.
